## Overview

Welcome to **Digit Recognizer**!  
This is my very first Machine Learning project, where I use **numpy** and a popular Kaggle dataset to build a model that recognizes handwritten digits. The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow along and experiment with the code.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the classic [MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data), available on Kaggle. It consists of 28x28 grayscale images of the digits 0–9.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model building and training using numpy
- Evaluation of model accuracy
- Visualization of results
- Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook format

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install the required Python packages with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prakharr1804/Digit-Recognizer.git
   cd Digit-Recognizer
   ```

2. **Download the Kaggle dataset:**
   - Go to the [Digit Recognizer Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)
   - Download `train.csv` and `test.csv`
   - Place them in the project directory

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open the notebook file and run the cells sequentially.

## Project Structure

```text

├── test.csv                 # Kaggle test dataset (not included)
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## Results

The notebook demonstrates how a basic ML model can be built from scratch using numpy, providing insights into the process of digit recognition. Sample visualizations and accuracy scores are included in the notebook.
